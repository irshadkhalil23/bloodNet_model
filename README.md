**Blood detection network**
Enhanced CCTV Blood Detection with Multiscale Attention and InceptionV3 for Real-Time Surveillance.
This paper has been submitted to Springer Nature for possiable publicaiton.


**Setup**
You need to install Tensorflow 2.9.0 and some basic libraries including PIL, cv2, numpy, etc.
For installaiton pip install -r requirements.txt



**How to Train?**
In the repository, the proposed_model.ipynb file is used to train, where the Attention_mechanism_with_InceptionV3_github_compress_de is used for compress version. 



**Datasets**
The datasets can be downloaded from the following links. We follow the training and testing data similar to the previous methods.
**The proposed dataset can be found at https://drive.google.com/file/d/15C9RU6sqTufVoCLU_ww4-0aSViZzpbn2/view?usp=drive_link

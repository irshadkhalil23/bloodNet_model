This paper has been submitted to Spriner Nature 

**Setup**
You need to install Tensorflow 2.9.0 and some basic libraries For installation used pip install -r requirements.txt

**How to Train?**
In the repository, the bloodnet.ipynb file is used to train the orignal model, where the Attention_mechanism_with_InceptionV3_github_compress_de is used for compress version.

**Datasets**
The datasets can be downloaded from the following links. We follow the training and testing data similar to the previous methods.
